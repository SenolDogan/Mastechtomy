# Biostatistical Analysis Rules for Cancer Patient Clinical DataB

## 1. Data Preparation and Quality Control
- Check for missing values and outliers in all variables
- Verify data types (numeric, categorical, ordinal)
- Ensure proper coding of categorical variables
- Handle missing data appropriately (imputation or exclusion)
- Standardize variable names and formats

## 2. Descriptive Statistics
### 2.1 Patient Demographics
- Age distribution (mean, median, range, SD)
- Gender distribution (frequencies, percentages)
- BMI distribution (mean, median, range, SD)
- Smoking status distribution

### 2.2 Clinical Characteristics
- Tumor characteristics:
  * Size distribution
  * Grade distribution
  * Histology types
  * Stage distribution
- Biomarker status:
  * ER/PR status
  * HER2 status
  * Ki67 levels
- Treatment characteristics:
  * Surgery types
  * Chemotherapy regimens
  * Radiation therapy

### 2.3 Outcome Variables
- Follow-up duration
- Survival rates
- Recurrence rates
- Complication rates

## 3. Inferential Statistics
### 3.1 Correlation Analysis
- Spearman correlation for non-normal data
- Pearson correlation for normal data
- Correlation matrix for multiple variables
- Significance testing (p < 0.05)

### 3.2 Group Comparisons
- T-tests for continuous variables between two groups
- ANOVA for continuous variables among multiple groups
- Chi-square tests for categorical variables
- Mann-Whitney U test for non-normal data
- Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple groups

### 3.3 Survival Analysis
- Kaplan-Meier survival curves
- Log-rank tests for survival differences
- Cox proportional hazards regression
- Hazard ratios and confidence intervals

### 3.4 Multivariate Analysis
- Multiple regression analysis
- Logistic regression for binary outcomes
- Cox regression for survival outcomes
- Confounding variable adjustment

## 4. Visualization Guidelines
### 4.1 Basic Plots
- Histograms for distribution
- Box plots for group comparisons
- Scatter plots for correlations
- Bar charts for frequencies

### 4.2 Advanced Plots
- Survival curves
- Forest plots for hazard ratios
- Heat maps for correlation matrices
- ROC curves for diagnostic accuracy

## 5. Reporting Standards
- Clear presentation of results
- Appropriate use of tables and figures
- Statistical significance reporting
- Effect size reporting
- Confidence intervals

## 6. Statistical Software Requirements
- R with required packages:
  * tidyverse for data manipulation
  * survival for survival analysis
  * ggplot2 for visualization
  * car for statistical tests
  * writexl for Excel output

## 7. Quality Assurance
- Double-check all calculations
- Verify statistical assumptions
- Review for clinical relevance
- Peer review of statistical methods

## 8. Documentation
- Document all data transformations
- Record statistical methods used
- Save all analysis scripts
- Maintain analysis log

## 9. Ethical Considerations
- Patient privacy protection
- Appropriate data anonymization
- Compliance with institutional guidelines
- Transparent reporting of results

## 10. Output Files
- Analysis results in Excel format
- High-resolution plots in PNG format
- Statistical reports in PDF format
- R scripts for reproducibility
