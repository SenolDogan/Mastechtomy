  * Chemotherapy regimens
  * Radiation therapy

### 2.3 Outcome Variables
- Follow-up duration
- Survival rates
- Recurrence rates
- Complication rates

## 3. Inferential Statistics
### 3.1 Correlation Analysis
- Spearman correlation for non-normal data
- Pearson correlation for normal data
- Correlation matrix for multiple variables
- Significance testing (p < 0.05)

### 3.2 Group Comparisons
- T-tests for continuous variables between two groups
- ANOVA for continuous variables among multiple groups

- Log-rank tests for survival differences
- Cox proportional hazards regression
- Hazard ratios and confidence intervals

### 3.4 Multivariate Analysis
- Multiple regression analysis
- Logistic regression for binary outcomes
- Cox regression for survival outcomes
- Confounding variable adjustment

## 4. Visualization Guidelines
### 4.1 Basic Plots
- Histograms for distribution
- Box plots for group comparisons
- Scatter plots for correlations
- Bar charts for frequencies

### 4.2 Advanced Plots
- Survival curves
- Forest plots for hazard ratios
- Heat maps for correlation matrices
- ROC curves for diagnostic accuracy

## 5. Reporting Standards
- Clear presentation of results
- Appropriate use of tables and figures

- Confidence intervals

## 6. Statistical Software Requirements
- R with required packages:
  * tidyverse for data manipulation
  * survival for survival analysis
  * ggplot2 for visualization
  * car for statistical tests
  * writexl for Excel output

## 7. Quality Assurance
- Double-check all calculations
- Verify statistical assumptions
- Review for clinical relevance
- Peer review of statistical methods

## 8. Documentation
- Document all data transformations
- Record statistical methods used
- Save all analysis scripts
- Maintain analysis log

## 9. Ethical Considerations
- Patient privacy protection
- Appropriate data anonymization
- Compliance with institutional guidelines
- Transparent reporting of results

## 10. Output Files
- Analysis results in Excel format
- High-resolution plots in PNG format
- Statistical reports in PDF format
- R scripts for reproducibility

# Cancer Mutation Data Analysis and Review Writing Guidelines

## Data Analysis Rules

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Always verify data quality and completeness
   - Document any missing values and their handling
   - Normalize mutation frequencies when comparing across studies
   - Use standardized mutation nomenclature (e.g., HGVS)

2. Statistical Analysis
   - Apply appropriate statistical tests based on data distribution
   - Include confidence intervals for mutation frequencies
   - Consider multiple testing corrections when applicable
   - Document all statistical methods and software used

3. Visualization
   - Use clear and informative plots
   - Include proper labels and legends
   - Choose appropriate color schemes for mutation types
   - Ensure accessibility of visualizations

## Review Writing Guidelines

1. Structure
   - Abstract: Clear summary of key findings
   - Introduction: Background and significance
